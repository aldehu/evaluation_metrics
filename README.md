## Previous installations
To run the scripts in python, you will need the pystan package. More details in https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/pystan.

## File description

**simL3N5000.py**:
It contains a Python script to perform simulations based on a Power Cauchy distribution. The purpose of this code is to generate simulated data with a parameter λ=3 and a sample size of 5000, replicating this process 100 times. For each replica, various metrics are calculated. Please refer to Section 4 of the article for details.
